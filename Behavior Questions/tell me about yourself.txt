Tell me about yourself.

Well, I googled myself this morning, and here is some information I found and would like to share with you:
Zhipeng Hu, a 27 years old man with a little fat body, who graduated as a master from Institute of Computing Techonology, Chinese Academey of Sciences and have been working at EMC since his graduation three years ago. 

As the first job in his career, he gradually grow from an ignorant young boy to an experienced result oriented senior software engineer. In the three years he consistently contribute himself into the EMC VNX2 product, which is delivered half years ago and is the industry leading midrange storage box. His working area is MCx, which is the short form of Multicore Everything and is the most core technology in VNX2. To be more specific, he worked on Multicore Raid in the first two years as the earliest MCx member in China, where he developed several features and troubleshooting a lot of problems to strengthen the storage system's availability and reliability. During that period, he and two other team members help the team build a good reputation and earn the trust from the U.S.team, since then the team is given more and more important development tasks. In the 2nd year's performance review, he earned the "Far Exceed Expectation" appraisal and is promoted to senior software engineer, which the other engineers usually takes 4 to 5 years to achieve. At the same year, he volunteerly join a newly founded team in China - the Multicore Cache team. In the latest year, he undertake several tasks to optimize the cache performance and troubleshooting tens of system level issues from both customer side and the system testing team side. This year he wants to pursuit a new career in a new industry and from a leading edge company - Amazon. So he wish he can earn the trust from the interviewers and can have the oppotunity to grow together with Amazon.
