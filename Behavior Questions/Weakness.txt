What is your weakness?

Well, honestly speaking, my biggest disadvantage is that sometimes I care too much about what the other people thinks about me, especially on the work I am doing. For example, when doing some tasks, no matter how small it is, I usually write a design document as perfect as I can and then send it to my tech leads and other related colleagues. Before sending the document to them, I would check the design again and again, also including the document format and word phrasing. That is because I do not want others to think that I am thoughtless and careless. You can imagin this usually takes more effort. But now I think I am gradually overcoming this weakness, because I found no matter how much you think about the design, there are always some problems you did not consider with your own effort. So recently I usually try my best to only gurantee the correctness of the big picture of the design, and later make it perfect through face to face discussion with colleagues. This saves both time and energy.
