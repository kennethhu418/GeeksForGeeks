1. Personally, I have been working on traditional industry (storage) for three years, and honestly speaking, there are few appealing and challenging technologies there. It is just like an old man. But I am a young man, and I should play with another young man, right? So it is time to move on to a new and the most challenging industry now. That is the Internet industry.  But as you know, there are a lot of Internet companies, why do I choose Amazon?

2. Amazon is a company that is making history, just like its motto:  "work hard, have fun, make history".

Just a few years ago,  in people's mind Amazon was just an e-commerce site. But now, it's got a lot more interesting and revolutionary projects cooking. For example, Amazon Web Services is the earliest commercial cloud computing product, and now is powering a lot of startup boom. This capability of transforming the internal technology that previously only powered its own sites to a mature product available outside means Amazon is an innovative and dynamic place. Joining Amazon can make me stand on top of the tides of leading-edge technology, and it will offer me a bigger stage to develop my talents.



3. Family reason.
